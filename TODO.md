# TODO: Large-Scale Crawling Improvements

## 1. Rotating Proxies for IP Ban Avoidance
**Priority:** High
**Implementation:**
- Integrate proxy rotation service (e.g., ScraperAPI, Bright Data, or custom proxy pool)
- Add proxy manager class to handle rotation logic
- Implement automatic proxy switching on 403/429 responses
- Track proxy health and blacklist failing proxies
- Consider residential vs datacenter proxies based on target sites

## 2. Enhanced Rate Limiting with Exponential Backoff
**Priority:** High
**Current Status:** Basic rate limiting exists
**Improvements Needed:**
- Add exponential backoff with jitter: `delay = min(cap, base * 2^attempt + random_jitter)`
- Implement per-domain rate limit configuration
- Add circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
- Track response times and adjust delays dynamically
- Implement adaptive rate limiting based on server response patterns

## 3. Robots.txt Crawl-Delay Support
**Priority:** Medium
**Implementation:**
- Parse robots.txt crawl-delay directive
- Store per-domain crawl delays in database
- Enforce delays in fetcher before making requests
- Add override option for testing (with warnings)
- Cache robots.txt files with TTL

## 4. Checkpoint and Resume System
**Priority:** High
**Implementation:**
- Save scraping state every N pages (configurable)
- Store queue state, visited URLs, and progress in database
- Add `--resume` flag to continue from last checkpoint
- Implement atomic checkpoint writes to prevent corruption
- Add checkpoint compression for large states
- Include worker state for exact resume positioning

## 5. Memory Usage Monitoring and Management
**Priority:** High
**Implementation:**
- Add memory profiling with `tracemalloc` or `memory_profiler`
- Implement periodic garbage collection: `gc.collect()` every N pages
- Monitor RSS/VSS memory usage and alert on thresholds
- Add memory-aware queue management (spill to disk if needed)
- Implement worker recycling after N pages processed
- Clear caches periodically (DNS, parsed content, etc.)

## 6. Bloom Filters for URL Deduplication
**Priority:** Medium
**Benefits:** O(1) lookups with minimal memory usage
**Implementation:**
- Use `pybloom-live` or implement custom bloom filter
- Configure false positive rate (e.g., 0.001%)
- Estimated memory: ~10 bits per URL for 1% false positive rate
- Persist bloom filter to disk for resume capability
- Consider counting bloom filter for URL revisit tracking
- Add telemetry for false positive rate monitoring

## 7. Distributed Crawling Architecture
**Priority:** Low (Future Enhancement)
**Architecture Options:**

### Option A: Master-Worker Pattern
- Central coordinator manages URL frontier
- Workers request batches of URLs
- Results sent back to coordinator
- Use Redis/RabbitMQ for job queue

### Option B: Peer-to-Peer
- Consistent hashing for URL distribution
- Each node responsible for domain subset
- Gossip protocol for state synchronization

### Implementation Requirements:
- Add job queue system (Celery, RQ, or custom)
- Implement distributed locks for coordination
- Add health checks and worker recovery
- Consider using Kubernetes for orchestration
- Implement data partitioning strategy

## 8. Content Hashing and Deduplication
**Priority:** High
**Current Status:** Basic content hashing exists
**Improvements:**
- Implement MinHash for near-duplicate detection
- Use SimHash for semantic similarity
- Store hashes in dedicated index for fast lookups
- Add threshold configuration for similarity matching
- Implement content normalization before hashing:
  - Remove timestamps, counters, dynamic content
  - Normalize whitespace and encoding
  - Extract main content (remove nav, ads, etc.)
- Track duplicate chains for analytics

## Additional Improvements to Consider

### 9. Smart Crawl Prioritization
- Implement PageRank-style URL prioritization
- Add freshness scoring for time-sensitive content
- Use ML model to predict high-value pages
- Implement adaptive depth limits per domain

### 10. Advanced Error Handling
- Categorize errors (network, parsing, server, etc.)
- Implement error-specific retry strategies
- Add dead letter queue for persistent failures
- Generate error reports with actionable insights

### 11. Performance Optimizations
- Add HTTP/2 support for multiplexing
- Implement connection pooling per domain
- Use uvloop for faster async operations
- Add DNS prefetching for discovered URLs
- Consider using Rust extensions for hot paths

### 12. Monitoring and Observability
- Add Prometheus metrics export
- Implement distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Create Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
- Add alerting for anomalies (rate drops, error spikes)
- Log aggregation with structured logging

### 13. Data Quality Assurance
- Add content validation rules
- Implement language detection and filtering
- Add adult/spam content detection
- Verify content completeness (partial loads)
- Track and report data quality metrics

### 14. Storage Optimizations
- Implement content compression (gzip/brotli)
- Add tiered storage (hot/cold data separation)
- Use object storage (S3) for large-scale content
- Implement incremental backups
- Add data lifecycle management

## Implementation Priority Order

1. **Phase 1 (Immediate):** Items 2, 4, 5, 8 - Core reliability
2. **Phase 2 (Short-term):** Items 1, 3, 6 - Scale improvements
3. **Phase 3 (Long-term):** Items 7, 9-14 - Enterprise features

## Notes

- Current system handles ~18-20 URLs/second with 100 workers
- Target: 100+ URLs/second for million-page crawls
- Consider cloud deployment for true scale (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Implement gradual rollout of new features with feature flags
